            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I reply, that in Mr. <hi>Cunter</hi>'s Book there the Uſe is ſet forth, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the obſcurity of the Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there, as to the reading of the Line; and alſo the dearneſs of the Book, many a one that would gladly learn, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred from taking pains therein, leſt they ſhould ſpend time and oyl to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and alſo for want of caſes fit to
<pb facs="tcp:172767:4"/>their purpoſe, they are apt to think it as to no purpoſe: Therefore that I might be as an <hi>ABCdarian</hi> to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental way of working, being the moſt proper for Mechanick Men, ſuch as <hi>Carpenters, Joyners, Maſons, Bricklayers,</hi> and the like; which for the moſt part are ignorant of Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick; and that knowledge might be increaſed any way, I thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and make no doubt of a good benefit to accrue thereby, to them whoſe capacities and purſes in theſe Critical times cannot well reach to other more difficult, and dear Authors: I ſhall not much Apologiſe for my ſelf, as to ſtyle or manner of writing (being like my ſelf;) what it is I beſeech you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in as good part as it was offered: I might have implored the aid of ſome more abler Pen, but I thought Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick men beſt underſtand them of their own profeſſion, in this and other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, becauſe they are men of the ſame ſtature in knowledge and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:172767:6"/>that many there be that can meaſure by the Plain Rule that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not uſe the Line of Numbers; and ſome alſo know not the uſe of the plain Rule neither: For theſe Reaſons I have added this Chapter of <hi>The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and uſe of the Carpenters-Plain-rule.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is call'd a <hi>Carpenters Rule,</hi> (rather-then a <hi>Joyners, Bricklayers, Maſons, Glaſiers,</hi> or the like) I ſuppoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they find the moſt abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it in their way, for they have as much or more occaſion to uſe it than moſt other Trades, though the ſame Rule muſt meaſure all kind of Superficies and solids, which two Meaſures meaſure every viſible ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which is to be meaſured. And it is uſually made of Box or Holly, 24 Inches in length, and commonly an Inch and half, or an Inch and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in breadth; and of thickneſs at pleaſure; and on the one ſide it is divided into 24 equal Inches, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Standard at <hi>Guild-hall
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:172767:6"/>London;</hi> and every one of thoſe 24 Inches is divided into eight parts, that is, Halfs, Quarters, and Half-quarters; and the Half-inches are known from the Quarters, and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the Half-quarters, by ſhort, longer, and longeſt ſtrokes; and at every whole Inch is ſet figures, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from 1 to 24, from the right hand toward the left, and theſe parts and figures are on both edges of one ſide of the Rule both ways numbred, to the intent that howſoever you hold the Rule you have the right end to meaſure from, provided you have the right ſide.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide you have the Lines of Timber and Board meaſure. The Timber-meaſure is that which begins at 8 and a half, that is, when the figures of the Timber-line ſtand upright to you, then I ſay it begins at the left end at 8 and ½, and proceeds to 36 within an Inch and ⅜ of an Inch of the end. Alſo of the beginning end of the Line of Timber-meaſure
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:172767:7"/>is a Table of figures, which contains the quantity of the Under-meaſure from one Inch ſquare to eight Inches ſquare, for the figure 9 comes upon the Rule, as you may ſee neer to 8 in the Table.</p>
                     <p>On or next the other edge, and ſame ſide you have the Line of Board-meaſure, and when thoſe figures ſtand upright, you have 6 at the left or beginning end, and 36 at the other (or right) end, juſt 4 Inches of the end unleſs it be divided up to 100, then it is nigh an inch and half of the end. This Line hath alſo his Table of Under-meaſure at the beginning end, and begins at 1 and goes to 6, and then the diviſions on the Rule do ſupply all the reſt to 100. Thus much for Deſcription: Now for Uſe.</p>
                     <p>The Inches are to meaſure the length or breadth of any Superficies or Sollid given, and the manner of doing it were ſuperfluous to ſpeak of, or once to mention, being not only eaſie, but even natural to every man,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:172767:7"/>for holding the Rule in the left hand; and applying it to the board or any thing to be meaſured, you have your deſire: But now for the uſe of the other ſide, I ſhall ſhew it in two or three examples in each meaſure that is Superficial or Sollid. And firſt in Superficial or Board-meaſure.</p>

                        <p>The breadth of any Superficies (as Board, or Glaſs, or the like) being given, to find how much in length makes a Square Foot, (or is equal to 12 inches broad, and 12 Inches long; for ſo much is a true Foot Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial.)</p>
                        <p>To do this, look for the number of Inches your Superficies is broad in the Line of Board-meaſure, and keep your finger there, and right againſt it on the Inches ſide you have the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of inches that goes to make up a Foot of Board or Glaſs, or any Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies. Suppoſe I have a peice 8 Inches broad, How many Inches make a Foot? I look for 8 on the Board-meaſure,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:172767:8"/>and juſt againſt my finger (being ſet to 8) on the Inch ſide, I find 18, and ſo many Inches long at that breadth goes to make a Foot Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial.</p>
                        <p>Again, ſuppoſe it had been 18 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches broad, then I find 8 Inches in length, to make a Foot ſuperficial; but if 36 Inches broad, then 4 Inches in length makes a Foot.</p>
                        <p>Or you may do it more eaſier thus: Take your Rule and hold it in your left hand, and apply it to the breadth of your Board or Glaſs, making the end that is next 36 even with one edge of the Board or Glaſs, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther edge of the Board ſheweth how many Inches or Quarters of an Inch goes to make a Foot of the Board or Glaſs. This is but the converſe of the former and needs no example, for laying the Rule to it, and looking on the Board-meaſure you have your deſire.</p>
                        <p>Or elſe you may do thus in all narrow peices under 6 inches broad.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:172767:8"/>As ſuppoſe 3 ¼ double 3 ¼ it makes 6 ½, then I ſay, that twice the length from ½ to the end of the Rule ſhall make a foot Superficial, or ſo much in length makes a foot.</p>

                        <p>Having found the breadth, and how much makes one Foot, turn that over as many times as you can, for ſo many Foot is there in that Superficies: But if it be a great breadth, then you may turn it over two or three times, and then take that together, and ſo ſay 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and till you come to the end of the Superficies.

                        <p>Firſt you have five ranks of figures, the firſt or uppermoſt is the number of inches that any Superficies is broad, and the other 4 are Feet, and Inches, and parts of an Inch that goes to make up a Foot of Superficial mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: As for example, at 5 Inches, broad you muſt have 2 Foot, 4 Inches, and 4 Fifths of an Inch more, that is, 4 parts of 5, the Inch being divided into 5 parts; but where you have but two figures beſide the uppermoſt, and Ciphers in the reſt, you muſt read it thus, At two Inches broad you muſt have ſix Foot in length, no Inches no parts.</p>

                        <p>Again, ſuppoſe it were 24 Inches ſquare, then I find 3 Inches in length makes a Foot, for ſo I find 3 Inches on the other ſide, juſt againſt 24: But if it were ſmall Timber, as under 9 Inches ſquare, then you muſt ſeek the ſquare in the upper rank in the Table, and right under you have the Feet Inches, and parts that go to make a Foot ſquare, as was in the Table of Board-meaſure. As ſuppoſe 7 Inches

                     <p>For the length of this Line of Numbers, know, that the longer it is the better it is, and for that purpoſe it hath been contrived ſeveral ways, as firſt into a Rule of two Foot long, and three Foot long by Mr. <hi>Gunter,</hi> and I ſuppoſe it was therefore called <hi>Gunter's Line.</hi> Then that Line dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled or laid ſo together, that you might work either right on, or croſs from one to another, by Mr. <hi>Windgate</hi> afterwards projected in a Circle, by Mr. <hi>Oughtred,</hi> and alſo to ſlide one by another, by the ſame Author; and laſt of all projected (and that beſt of all hitherto, for largeneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently for exactneſs) into a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, or winding circular Line, of 5, or 10, or 20 turns, or more or leſs,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:172767:13"/>by Mr. <hi>Browne,</hi> the uſes being in all of them in a manner the ſame, only ſome with Compaſſes, as Mr. <hi>Gunter</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Windgate</hi>'s; and ſome with flat Compaſſes, or an opening Index, as Mr. <hi>Oughtred</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Browne</hi>'s, and one without either as the ſliding Rules; but the Rules or Precepts that ſerve for the uſe of one, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently ſerve for any: But the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that I ſhall chiefly confine my ſelf to, is that of Mr <hi>Gunter</hi>'s; being the moſt proper for to be inſcribed on a Carpenters Rule, for whoſe ſakes I undertake this collection of the moſt uſeful, convenient, and proper appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to their uſes in Arithmatick and Geometry. Thus much for defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of what manner of Lines of Numbers there be, and of what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend chiefly to handle in this place.</p>
                     <p>The order of the diviſions on this Line of numbers, and commonly on moſt other, is thus, it begins with 1, and ſo proceeds with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; and then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:172767:14"/>9, 10; whoſe proper power or order of numeration is thus: The firſt 1 doth ſignifie one tenth of any whole number or integer; as one tenth of a Foot, Yard, Ell, Perch, or the like; or the tenth of a penny, ſhilling, pound, or the like, either in weight, or number, or meaſure; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, 2 is 2 tenths; 3, three tenths; and all the ſmall intermediate diviſions, are 100 parts of an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or a tenth, of one of the former tenths; ſo that 1 in the middle, is one whole integer, and 2 onwards two integers, 10 at the end is 10 inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: Thus the line is in its moſt proper acception or natural divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>But if you are to deal with a greater number then 10, then 1 at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning muſt ſignifie 1 integer, and in the middle 10 integers, and 10 at the end 100 integers. But if you would have it to a figure more, then the firſt 1 is ten, the ſecond a hundred, the laſt 10 a thouſand. If you proceed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:172767:14"/>further, rhen the firſt 1 is a 100. the middle 1 a 1000. and the 10. at the end is 10000. which is as great a number as you can well diſcover, on this or moſt ordinary lines of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: and ſo far with convenient care, you may reſolve a queſtion very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly. Now any number being given under 10000. to find the point re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting it on the rule, do thus.</p>

                        <p>Firſt, I would find the point upon the line of numbers repreſenting 12. now the firſt figure of this number is one, therefore I take the middle one for the firſt figure; then the next figure being 2.

                        <p>Thirdly, For 2. reckon two cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſmes from that 7<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> tenth for 20.</p>
                        <p>And laſtly, For 8. you muſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably eſtimate that following cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſme, to be divided into 10. parts (if it be not expreſs'd, which in lines of ordinary length cannot be done) and 8. of that ſuppoſed 10. is the preciſe point for 1728. the number propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be found, and the like of any number whatſoever.</p>
                        <p>But if you were to find a fraction, or broken number, then you muſt conſider, that properly, or abſolutely, the line doth expreſs none but deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal fractions: as thus, 1/10 or 1/100 or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:172767:16"/>1/1000 and more neerer the rule in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon acception cannot expreſs; as one inch, and one tenth, or one hundredth or one thouſandth part of an inch, foot, yard, perch, or the like, in weight, number, or time, it being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to be applyed to any thing in a decimal way: (but if you would uſe other fractions, as quarters, half quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſixteens, twelves, or the like, you may reaſonably read them, or elſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them into decimals, from thoſe fractions, of which more in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chapters;) for more plaineſs ſake, take two or three obſervations:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That you may call the 1. at the beginning, either one thouſand, one hundred, or one tenth, or one abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, that is, one integer, or whole number, or ten integers, or a hundred, or a thouſand integers, and the like may you call 1. in the middle, or 10. at the end. 2. That whatſoever value or denomination you put on 1, the ſame value or denomination all the other figures muſt have ſucceſſively, either
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:172767:16"/>increaſing forward, or decreaſing backwards, and their intermediate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions accordingly, as for example;</p>
                        <p>If I call 1 at the beginning of the line, one tenth of any integer, then 2 following muſt be two tenths, 3. three tenths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 1 in the middle 1 integer, 2 two integers, and 10 at the end muſt be ten integers.</p>
                        <p>But if one at the beginning be one integer, then 1 in the middle muſt be 10 integers, and 10 at the end 100 integers, and all the intermediate fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 integers, and every longeſt diviſion between the figures, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> integers, and the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt diviſions tenths of thoſe integers, and ſo in proportion infinitely: as [1<hi rend="sup">10</hi> 1. 10] [1. 10. 100.] [10. 100-1000.] [100. 1000. 10000.] in all which 4 examples, the firſt order of Figures, <hi>viz.</hi> 1/10 1. 10. 100 is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the firſt 1. on the line of numbers: the ſecond order of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. 10. 100. 1000. is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented

                        <p n="3">3. If the number be a decimal fraction, then you work as if it were an abſolute whole number; but if it be a whole number, joyned to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimal fraction, it is wrought here as

Therefore I conclude that 40 men will perform as much in 72 hours as 60 men will do in 48 hours.</p>
                        <p>Note, That this back Rule of 3, may for the moſt part be wrought by the direct Rule of 3.</p>
                        <p>If you do but duely conſider the order of the Queſtion, for you muſt needs grant that fewer men muſt have longer time, and the contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the anſwer muſt be in proportion to the queſtion, which might have been wrought thus as well. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent from 40 to 60 will reach the ſame way from 48 to 72 in direct proportion: Or contrarily, as 60 to 40, ſo is 72 to 48. which you ſee is but by Turning the queſtion to its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect opperation, according to the true reaſon of the queſtion.</p>

                        <p>Alwayes in the double rule of 3, 5 terms are propounded, and a ſixth is required, 3 of which terms are of ſuppoſition, and two of demand; now the difficulty is in placing them, which is beſt done thus; as in this Example.</p>
                        <p>If 5 Scholars ſpend 20 <hi>l.</hi> in 3 months, How many pounds will ſerve 9 Scholars for 6 months?</p>

                        <p>Then next for the right placing them obſerve which of the terms of Suppoſition is of the ſame denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the term required, as here the 20 <hi>l.</hi> is of the ſame denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the how many pounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.

                        <p>Then the work is performed by two ſingle rules of 3 direct, thus:</p>
                        <p>Extend the Compaſſes from 5 to 20. the ſame extent applyed the ſame way from 9 ſhall reach to 369 a 4th. this is the firſt operation: Then as 3 to 36: the 4th. ſo is 6 to 72 the number of pounds required.

The Rule of find
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:172767:29"/>which is in this manner: You muſt ſet (or ſuppoſe pricks to be ſet) pricks under the firſt figure to the left hand, the fourth figure, the ſeventh and the tenth; now if by this means the laſt prick to the left hand ſhall fall on the laſt figure, as it doth in 1728, then the unit will be beſt placed at 1 in the middle of the Line, and the Root, the Square and Cube will all fall forward toward the end of the Line.</p>
                        <p>But if it fall on the laſt but 1, as it doth in 17280 then the unit may be placed at 1 in the beginning of the Line, and the Cube in the ſecond length, or elſe the unit may be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at 10 in the end of the Line, and the Cube in the firſt part of the Line, you may help your ſelf, as in the firſt Problem of the 2 Chapter.) But if the laſt prick fall under the laſt but two, as in 172800, it doth then place the unit always at 10 in the end of the Line, then the Root, the Square, and Cube, will all fall backward, and be found in the ſecond part, between
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:172767:29"/>the middle 1 and the end of the Line. By theſe Rules it doth appear that the Cube root of 8 is 2, of 27 is 3, of 64 is 4 of 125 is 5, of 216 is 6, of 345 is 7, of 512 is 8, of 729 is 9, of 1000 is 10.

                     <p>The ordinary meaſure, and moſt in uſe, is a <hi>Twofoot Rule,</hi> divided into 24 Inches, and every Inch into 8 parts; that is, Halſs, Quarters, and Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters; but theſe parts not agreeing with the parts on the Line of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which are Decimals, or tenth parts, is bred very much trouble; and there cannot be exactneſs without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſmall parts, as ½ quarters of Inches, or elſe uſing of Reduction; and it is alſo as troubleſom by Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick as by the Line of Numbers. To avoid which, I would adviſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to meaſure altogether by Foot-meaſure, (that is, a Foot divided into 1000 parts (or rather as is ſufficient for ordinary uſe, 100) and then the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:172767:31"/>diviſions on the numbers will agree fitly to the parts on your Rule, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any trouble for fractions; for ſo doing, Fractions do become whole Numbers as it were, and are wrought accordingly: But if you uſe it not in meaſuring, yet you may have it ſet for to help you for the ready reducing of ſuch Numbers as ſhall require it, though I ſhall apply it to Inches alſo, as it is commonly uſed, that it may appear uſeful both ways, accordingly as any man ſhall be affected.</p>
                     <p>The like reaſon holdeth for Inches, Yards, Ells and Perches, or any other meaſure; for thereby the Work is made more eaſie, as ſhall appear anon.</p>
                     <p>Therefore firſt by Foot-meaſure only.</p>

                        <p> The only difficulty in this Work is to know now many figures is to be cut off from the laſt Work, the beſt Guide wherein is experience, for one that is experienced will hardly call a Veſſel of 10 Gallons a 100, nor the contrary, not one of a 100 a 1000, or the contrary, much leſs 10; now if you work right the miſtake muſt be to much or none. For 360 Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons muſt needs be more then one Barrel, and yet not a 100, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs be 10, and the reſt cut off, as the 100 thouſand part of a Barrel.</p>
                        <p>But to apply this to the Line of Numbers, for which chiefly my aim is, the whole work is thus.</p>
                        <p>Extend the Compaſſes from 1 to the inches Diameter, the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſhall reach from thence the ſame way to the product.</p>
                        <p>Then the extent from 1 to the laſt Product ſhall reach from the inches deep the ſame way to another product which is the Square of the Diameter,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:172767:56"/>multiplyed by the depth; which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and note. Then laſtly, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent from 1 to 0. 2785 for Gallons, or to 0.775 for Barrels, ſhall reach the ſame way from the laſt found pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct (or the Square of the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter multiplyed by the length) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in Gallons or Barrels required.</p>

                        <p>As 1 to 60 the Inches in Diameter ſo is 60 to 3600: Again, as 1 to 3600 ſo is 36 the inches deep to 129600, the Square of the Diameter multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by the depth in Inches.</p>

                        <p>As 1 to 0. 775 ſo is 129600 to 10 Barrels, and a little more.</p>
                        <p>This Rule is for all Cylender-like round Veſſels, but if the ſides be ſtreight and taper, then the uſual way and ſomewhat neer the Truth is, to add the Diameters at the top and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom together, and to take the half for the mean Diameter, which when you have got, work as before.</p>

                        <p>This way by the Line of Numbers is very quick and ready. Thus,</p>
                        <p>Extend the Compaſſes from the Gage-points either 17.15 for Wine, or 18.95 for Ale, to the mean Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, the ſame extent being turned twice the ſame way from the length, ſhall reach to the content in Gallons.</p>
                        <p>The Extent from 18.95 to 60 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twice repeated from 36, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches deep ſhall reach to 361 <hi>ferè,</hi> the content in Ale Gallons.</p>

                        <p>Let a peice of Board be given to be meaſured that is 3. 3. 5. <hi>i. e.</hi> three Foot, three Inches, and 5 eights, one way, and 2. 3. 4, the other way. I ſet the numbers down in this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <gap reason="math">

                           </gap> &amp; then right on, firſt as the line in the Scheme from 2 to 3 leads.</p>
                        <p>I ſay thus, 3 times 2 is 6, ſet 6 right under 2. and 3 as in the example, in the left page: for 6 Foot, as is clear, if you conſider the Scheme over the example, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſquares noted with <hi>f.</hi> then for the next I ſay croſs-wiſe, 2 times 3 is 6, <hi>viz.</hi> long Inches, as you may perceive, by the 2 long ſquares marked with 9 L. and 6 L.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:172767:86"/>which 6 I put in the next place to the right hand, as in the example; then for the next, <hi>viz.</hi> 3 times 3. is 9, (croſwiſe, as the ſtroke from 3 to 3 ſhews) which 9 is alſo 9 long Inches, as the Scheme ſheweth, and muſt be put under 6, in the ſecond place toward the right hand, in the Scheme it is expreſs'd by the 3 long Squares, marked with L 9. Then laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Inches, 3 times 3 is 9, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right up, as the ſtroke from the 2 threes lead you: but note, this 9 muſt be ſet in the next place to the right hand, becauſe they are but 9 Square Inches, but had the Product been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 12, you muſt have Subſtracted the 12 <hi>s.</hi> out, and ſet them in the long Inches place, and the remainder, where this 9 now ſtandeth, and this 9 is expreſs'd in the Scheme, by the little Square in the corner markt with (□ 9.)</p>
                        <p>Then now for the Fractions, or 8 parts of an Inch, firſt ſay, croſwiſe as the longeſt prick line doth lead you
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:172767:87"/>to; 3 times 4 is 12, for which 12, you muſt ſet down 1. 6, that is 1 long Inch, and 6 Square Inches, the reaſon is, a piece 8 half quarters of an Inch broad, and 12 Inches long, is a long Inch, or the twelfth part of a Foot ſuperficial, and if 8 be 12 Square Inches, then 4 muſt needs be 6 Square Inches: therefore, in ſtead of 12, I ſet down 1. 6, as you may ſee in the example, and in the leaſt long Square of the Diagram, or Scheme. Then do likewiſe for the other long Square, which is alſo multiplyed acroſs; as, two times 5 is 10. that is, as I ſaid before, 1. 3, as the Example and Scheme make manifeſt, conſidering what I laſt ſaid, and it is marked by the 2. 00. But if this or the other had come to a greater number, you muſt have Subſtracted 8 <hi>s.</hi> as oft as you could, and ſet down the remainder in the place of Square Inches, and the number of 8 <hi>s.</hi> in the place of Long Inches, as here you ſee.</p>
                        <p>Then for the two ſhorter Long
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:172767:87"/>Squares next the corner, ſay croſwiſe again, Three times 5 is 15, that is 1, 7, becauſe eight Half-quarters an Inch long do make one ſquare Inch, as well as eight Half-quarters a Foot long made one Long Inch: Therefore I ſet 1 in the place of ſquare Inches, and 7 in the next place to the right hand, and it is expreſſed in the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram by the ſmall long ſquare, and marked with * 1. 7.</p>
                        <p>Then again for the other little long ſquare, ſay croſwiſe, as the ſhorter prick line leads you, Three times 4 is 12, that is 1. 4; and do by this as the laſt: It is noted in the Scheme by 1-4.</p>
                        <p>Then laſtly for 5 times 4, as the ſhort prick line ſheweth you, is 20: out of which 20 take the 8 <hi>ſ.</hi> and ſet them down in the laſt place, and the 4 remaining you may either neglect, (or ſet it down a place further) for you cannot ſee it on the Rule; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I thus adviſe, if it be under 4. neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it quite, but if above, increaſe the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:172767:88"/>next a figure more if 4 then it is a half, and ſo may be added; for note, 64 of theſe parts make but one ſquare Inch; of which parts, the little ſquare in the right hand lower corner of the Scheme is 20, for which I ſet down 2. 4, that is two Half-quarters, and 4 of 64. which is the laſt work, as you may ſee by the Scheme and Example.</p>
                        <p>Now to add them together ſay thus, 4 is 4, which I put furtheſt to the right hand, as it were uſeleſs, becauſe not to be expreſt; then 472 are 13, from which take 8, and for it carry 1 on to the next place, or as many times 1 as you find 8, and ſet down the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, which here is 5, then 1 I carried, and 13619, is 21, from which I take 12, and ſet down 9, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 12 ſquare Inches, is one long Inch: then 1 I carried, (or more, had there been more 12 <hi>s.</hi>) and 1169 is 18, from which take 12, as before, there remains 6, that is, 6 long Inches, and ſo had there been more 12 <hi>s.</hi> ſo many you muſt carry to the next

                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p n="3">3.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:172767:89"/>back again to 1. 10, or in large qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drants the 50 is called a 100, and 10. 20, and 20. 40, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the line of ſhadows, is figured with 12.11.10.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1. in the middle againſt 50, and then 1. 2. 3. to 12. back again; the firſt part of which is called the right ſhadow: the other is called contrary ſhadows.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Next to that you have two more lines, (concentrick to the former in quadrants and Sextances; But in round Dials, they are but as it were concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trickal) on which are divided a Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender of months and days, if they be large, but in thoſe of ordinary big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is but every fifth and tenth day expreſſed; and ſingle days are reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly underſtood, of which two Circles the uppermoſt contains that half year in which the days be increaſing, <hi>viz.</hi> from the 10. of <hi>December</hi> to the 10. or 11. of <hi>June;</hi> and the lowermoſt Circle contains the other half, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing or ſhortning. And at the end of every month there is a long

                     <p n="5">5. Next to the Kalender, you have 25 concentrick Circles, if they are lines of declination, or but 19, if they be lines of the Suns-riſing, and every 5 of them if they be declinations, or every fourth if they be lines of riſing, is expreſs'd and diſtinguiſhed with pricks; for every 5 and tenth Degree of declination, or for every whole, and half hour of Suns riſing; as the figures ſet to them, at the end of them (next the horizontal line) ſhew, if they be of Suns riſing being 4. 5. 6. or the contrary end if they be lines of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lination, noted with 10.20. will ſhew; the uppermoſt of which 25, or 19 lines, repreſents the <hi>Aequinoctial:</hi> and the loweſt the two <hi>Tropiques</hi> of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and <hi>Capricorn.</hi>

That is, the ſame line that is for 4 in the morning, is for 8 at night, and the like is both for winter and ſummer; the reaſon is, look how high the Sun is at 7 in the morning, ſo high is it at 5 in the afternoon, and the like.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Thoſe lines that deſcend from the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> toward the left hand
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:172767:91"/>are the winter hours, and are figured above as before, but below with 12.1.2.3, for in the ſhorteſt days, the Sun ſets before 4, and in large Dials, there are halfs, and quarters alſo, and diſtinguiſhed as before, but of whole hours at the <hi>Tropiques</hi> there is but 4, but at the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> there be 6, and a point repreſenting the hour of 6.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. And laſtly, in the ſpare room beyond the <hi>Aequinoctial,</hi> you have ſet a perpetual Almanack, whereby, if you know the day of the month, you may find the day of the week, and the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Alſo in ſome Almanacks, you have the Dominical letter, Leap-year, and Epact, to find the Moons-age, the largeſt and uppermoſt of which ranks of figures, are the 12 months, the next 5 are the 31 days of the month, and the reſt, if any be, are according to their names: thus much for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
                     <p>One thing more I think conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:172767:93"/>fallen on 2, (that is to ſay, of right ſhadow) then the object is, but half the length of the ſhadow meaſuring upon a level ground, from the end of the ſhadow, to right under the object that cauſeth the ſhadow; if it falls on 3, the ſhadow is 3 times as long as the thing is, and ſo to 12, to 12 times longer, and the ſtrokes between note one tenth, 2 tenths, 3 tenths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> more; but if it falls beyond 1, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſhadow, then the ſhadow is ſhorter accordingly, as will appear very plain with a little practice.</p>

But if it had fallen on 25 of the quadrat, or 2 on the ſhadows, then the diſtance had been twice as much
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:172767:94"/>as the height, (if right ſhadow) but for contrary ſhadow, the contrary. I ſhall ſay no more to this, only give you a caution, that if you look from the height of any place downwards, then you muſt put that pin next the Centre to your eye, and look down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to your object, and then the ſide which before was right ſhadow, will become contrary ſhadow, and the contrary. Note one thing further, that if your inſtrument be a Sextance, or a Circle, and you cannot have all the quadrat, as on a quadrant: you may then move the pin to the hole at the other end of the horizontal line: and you ſhall ſee that defect to be ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

Alſo note the hours of 11 and 12 are neer together, therefore you muſt be ſo much the more cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in obſerving to hold the Dial wel, and to look juſt on, or between the parallel of declination or riſing, and at 12 of the clock you may look in the Kalender for the day of the month, for juſt on that day will the ſhadow be at 12 of the clock, and ſhort of it (increaſing) before, (but decreaſing) after 12.</p>

                              <p>Laſtly, if you meet with a Dial that hath the Kalender of Months on the backſide, then it is but laying a thred over the day, and on the line of Declination, the thred cuts the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent number of Declination, as before; alſo the riſing, and true place, and amplitude, as I hinted before; Then having the number, look for the line on the other ſide that ſhall have the ſame number, and proceed as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

                     <p>There are two places in the Noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or more commonly it is one plate of braſs on the backſide of another Inſtrument; for the one hath o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nly 34 hours, and each hour is divided into quarters, or more parts, as the largeneſs of the plate will admit: This Nocturnal hath the hour divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 12 parts, that is, into 5 minutes a piece, and when the Nocturnal is
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:172767:103"/>added to another inſtrument, theſe hours and parts are ſet on that, and this one part of it.</p>
                     <p>The other part of it is a Rundle, or round plate of Braſs, on which is deſcribed, firſt and next the Edge, 365 diviſions, repreſenting the days of the year, every month having the name, at the beginning of it, or the firſt letter of the name, <hi>viz.</hi> I. F. M. A. M. I. I. A. S.O.N.D. and a longer ſtroke, at the laſt day, than any of the reſt; and figures at the tenth and twentieth day, for the more ready finding of it: next within, you have the 360 Degrees of a Circle, to find the right aſcenſion of any ſtar, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with 10. 20.30.40.50. to 360. beginning at the tenth of <hi>March,</hi> and proceeding onwards as aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Then you have a Scale of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, numbered both ways, from the Equator, and Pole, <hi>viz.</hi> 10. and 80, 20. &amp; 70, 30. &amp; 60.40. &amp; 50.50 &amp; 40, by which you may find the Declination, or diſtance from the Pole of any ſtar.</p>

                        <pb n="202" facs="tcp:172767:104"/> 4. You have 5 Conſtellations of thoſe Stars next the North-pole, and the reſt of the Stars of other conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, as come within that compaſs. The names of which conſtellations are, the great Bear, the little Bear, Cephus, Caſſiopeia and the Dragon, and part of Perſeus, and Auriga.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. You have a ſtring lying croſs the Diameter, from 12 to 12, for a Meridian. The uſes follow in order.</p>
                     <p>But for their ſakes that may be willing to know more Stars, than are here ſet down, I have provided a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger plate, all the noted Stars from the Northpole to the <hi>Aequinoctial,</hi> whoſe uſe is the ſame with this, therefore I ſhall ſpeak no more as to the uſe of that then this: only there is more variety, and it is a great help to the knowing of the Stars, for which cauſe it way by me chiefly compoſed.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then for the uſe, the moſt hard and difficult thing is to know the Stars one from another: The beſt means to know which next to a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:172767:104"/>is to compare them you do know in the Rundle with them in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and then one with another, as thus:</p>
                     <p>In a night when the Stars may be ſeen, and it is beſt for to learn when there is not ſo many Stars ſeen, (as there is in ſome clear froſty nights) for then onely thoſe in the Nocturnal will be ſeen: Look toward the North part of the heavens, and you ſhall ſee 7 fair Stars ſtanding as you ſee the 7 in the great Bear, beginning at the tail of the Bear; and the two laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bright Stars; from which two if you conceive a line to be drawn, it will cut the Pole-ſtar; and when you find the Pole-ſtar, and them two, they will help you to find all the reſt with diligent obſervation.</p>
                     <p>Another way to find the North-ſtar, is to hang a plummet on the Centre, and make it play on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the latitude of the place, and then lift it up toward the North part of the heavens, till you ſee a bright
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:172767:105"/>ſtar, ſo bright, as one of the 7 in the great Bear, for that is the Pole-ſtar. <hi>Note</hi> that it is not the very Pole, as you may ſee by the <hi>Nocturnal,</hi> but it is the neareſt the Pole; this being known, and the great Bear, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every Country-man knows, by the name of <hi>Charles-wane;</hi> with help of the ſtring lying acroſs, you may ſtraight-way look Eaſt or Weſt North or South, or between, for any of the Stars ſet down in the Nocturnal, for the ſtring you muſt conceive to lye North and South always: By theſe or the like means you may come to know all the Stars in the Nocturnal. And if you attain to know them, with the help of the other paper, you may know all in the half-Hemiſphere that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Pole and Equinoctial.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, to find when any ſtar comes to the Meridian. The Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian is a line or arch of a Circle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be drawn through (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ſtar in the tail of the little Bear, which is) the Pole Star, right
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:172767:105"/>over your head; and to make you underſtand this the better, Hang a line with a weight at the end of it, out of a window that looks to the North, a good way from the houſe, or on a tree, or corner of a houſe, and then go to and fro till you ſee the line cut by the North-ſtar, how much and on which ſide the Nocturnal will ſhew you, and that line, then is the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian-line; and then what ſtar ſoever is under the line and the North-ſtar, or Pole, (for when you uſe the ſtars of <hi>Caſſiopeia,</hi> the ſtar is the true Pole, as by the Meridian-line on the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturnal you may plainly ſee) that ſtar I ſay is exactly on the Meridian, be it above or below the Pole; for ſo it be in that direct line with the Pole, it matters not, ſo you have the hours divided round about; but you may be able in a little practice to gueſs, without the Plumb-line, yet it will marvellouſly rectifie your judgment, till you be more ready at it. Theſe two being known, all the reſt is very eaſie as may be.</p>

                     <p>Suppoſe on the 1 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> I ſee by the means beforeſaid, the Star in the tip of the great Bears tail, to be in the Meridian, then bring that Star juſt under the ſtring, and look for the 1 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and right againſt it you have 4 a Clock, and 8 minutes in the morning: Or elſe ſet the day of the month to 12, and then keep it fixed all that night, then the thred laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Star that is in the meridian, ſhall at the ſame time in the hours ſhew the hour, counting backwards.</p>

                        <p n="4">4. To find the right aſcenſion of a ſtar, bring the ſtar under the thred,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:172767:106"/>and the thread ſheweth his right aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the degrees, ſo you will find the right aſcenſion of the ſtar in the great Bears tail to be 203.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. To find the declination of a ſtar, bring the ſtar under the line, then prick a pin thorough the ſtring, and juſt in the middeſt of the ſtar, then keep the pin there; and bring the Scale of declination right under the line, and pin: and the pins point ſheweth you his declination, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Pole; by theſe two laſt, you may adde any ſtar, whoſe right aſcenſion, and declination you know; and ſo put in all, as may be ſeen in this compaſs, at any time or by the right aſcenſion only (being ſufficient for this purpoſe, to wit the hour of the night,) you may add the Buls eye, little Dog, 7 Stars, Orion, or any other chief principal ſixed ſtar: and make uſe of it, to find the hour of the night withal.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The day of the month, and hour being given, to know what ſtar is
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:172767:107"/>on or neer the meridian. Set the day of the month to the hour of the night, and the ſtars that are under the ſtring, are all on the meridian: and if there be none juſt, you ſhall ſee what half, or 3, or 4 part, between 2 is on the meridian, and this is an excellent way to help you to know the ſtars.</p>
                        <p>Alſo note, That to uſe this Paper peice paſted on a Board, and not to turn about, do thus;</p>
                        <p>Lay a thred on the Star you find to be in the Meridian, then with a pair of Compaſſes meaſure from the thred to the next 12, the ſame extent laid the ſame way, in the line of months and hours, ſhall reach from the day of the month to the hour required.</p>

                     <p>A Sliding-rule is onely two Rules, or Rule-pieces fitted together, with a Braſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſocket at each end, that they ſlip not out of the grove; and the Line of Numbers thereon, is cut acroſs the moving Joynt on each
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:172767:109"/>piece, the ſame diviſions on both ſides: only the placing of the lines differ, for on one ſide of the Rule you have 1 ſet at the beginning, and 10 at the end on each piece; but on the other ſide 1 is ſet in the middle, and the reſt of the figures anſwerably both ways; on purpoſe to make it large, and to take in all numbers: and the reading of this is the very ſame with the other; for if you pull out the Rule, and ſet 10 at the end, right againſt 1 at the beginning, then on both pieces, you have the former Line of Numbers completely; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall ſay nothing as to deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, or reading of it, but come ſtreight to the uſe.</p>
                     <p>On the edges of the Rule is uſually ſet Foot-meaſure, being the Foot or 12 Inches parted into 100 parts; and on the flat ſides next to the Foot-meaſure, Inches in 8 parts; and on the other flat edges on the other ſide, the Line of Board-meaſure, and ſometime Timber-meaſure, whoſe
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:172767:109"/>uſe is ſhewed in the firſt Chapter of the Book; but note if the Rule be a juſt Foot when it is ſhut, as Glaſiers commonly have it, then the Inches are ſet alike on both ſides, and the Foot-meaſure alike on both edges: and being pulled out as far as the braſſes will ſuffer, it wants about one Inch of two Foot; but if you would have it to be two Foot juſt when pulled out, as it is made for Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters uſe, then the Inches on one ſide, and Foot-meaſure on the ſame reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal edge, muſt be figured other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to 25. Inches, and the Foot-meaſure with 110. near the end 120, 130, 140, 150, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with 210 at the very end, ſhewing the meaſure from end to end, being drawn out to any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; as is very eaſie to conceive of, and need no example to illuſtrate it withal.</p>
                     <p>Note alſo in uſing the Line of Numbers, that that ſide or part of it, on which you find the firſt part or
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:172767:110"/>term in the queſtion, ſhall always call the firſt ſide, and then the other muſt needs be the ſecond, that the Rules and Examples may be ſhortned and made eaſie.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, when the figures (on the Timber-ſide) ſtand right toward you, fit to read: then that half or piece next to your right-hand, I call the right-ſide, the other is of neceſſity the left.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the figures on the right ſide are, firſt at the lower end, (where the Braſs is pin'd faſt) either 3, or 4, or 5, it matters not much which, yet to have 3 there is beſt: then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11, for ſo many Inches, then 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12, under the braſs at the top, for ſo many Feet: the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions between to one Foot, are
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:172767:117"/>quarters of Inches the next above 1 Foot, are only whole Inches, as you may plainly ſee.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, at 1 Foot you have the word Square, at 1 Foot 1 Inch ½ is a Mark, and right againſt it is ſet TD, noting the true Diameter of a round ſolid body; at an Inch further is 12 ſet, which I call ſmall 12, being in ſmall figures. Again at 1 Foot 3 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches better, is another Mark, and right againſt it the word Diameter, for the Diameter of a piece of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber according to the uſual Engliſh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance. Then again at 3 Foot 6 Inches ½ neer, is T R, for the true cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of a round Cillender. Laſtly, at 4 Foot is the word Round, noting the circumference according to the uſual allowance, whoſe uſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                     <p>Note alſo if you put on the Gage-points for Ale or Wine, with the mean Diameter, and length, you may Gage any Wine or Beer-veſſel, the Wine at 17 Inches ¼: the Ale or Beer at 18.95.</p>
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:172767:118"/>
                     <p> Fourthly, the figures on the left ſide, are not much unlike the right, for 1 at the beginning is one Inch, and ſo it proceeds by quarters of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to one Foot; then by figures at the Feet, and the diviſions all whole Inches to 10 Foot, then every whole Foot, and half and quarter, or 10th. to 100, or 140, or 150 Foot; and this I call the left-ſide, the other the right ſide; ſo that from one Inch at the lower end, to one Foot, every Inch hath a figure; from one Foot to 10 Foot, every Foot hath a figure, and from 10 Foot to a 100, every 10th. Foot only is figured. I have been very plain in explaining this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would avoid vain repetitions in the following uſes, wherein you ſhall have firſt the moſt ordinary and eaſie queſtions, and then the more hard and critical, and leſs uſeful.</p>

                        <p>For all ordinary pieces, ſet the word Diameter for the uſual meaſure, or TD for true meaſure, always to the length on the left: then right againſt the inches, or feet and inches Diameter on the right, on the left is the content required.</p>

                           <p>At 5 inches Diameter, and 30 foot long, you ſhall find 4 foot ½ an inch true meaſure, for the content required</p>
                           <p>But for very ſmall pieces, ſet TD or round to the length, as before; then counting 1 foot on the right for 1 inch, and 6 inches for ½ an inch; on the left you ſhall have the anſwer or content required. But note as the right-ſide is diminiſhed, ſo is the left, for one foot on the left is a <hi>12th</hi> of 1 Inch of timber, whereof 12 makes a foot, or 1 long inch, a foot long,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:172767:125"/>and 1 inch ſquare, and every inch on the left is 1 ſquare inch; thus at 2 foot long, and ½ an inch diameter, it is 4 □ inches ¾ in content.</p>
                           <p>But for a great piece under a 1000 foot, ſet TD or diameter to 1. 2. or 3 foot, called 10. 20. or 30 foot: then right againſt the feet and inches diameter, you have a content augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted accordingly, as at 30 foot long, and 7 foot diameter, you have 1140 foot for the true content uſing TD.</p>
                           <p>But for very great pieces, as Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Tuns and the like, as in the 3 Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the 5 Chapter, you cannot work this without Compaſſes, and thus it is done, take the diſtance from the top 12 to TD, then ſet one point in one foot on the right, then ſlide the rule till the other point ſhall reach to the inches deep or long, reckoned as before in round meaſure, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 inch for 10 inches, 2 for 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on the left: then counting 2 foot on the right for 24 foot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> right againſt it on the left, you ſhall have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:172767:126"/>in feet. But this is much eaſier wrought thus.</p>
                           <p>Set 3 foot on the right ſide the gage point for a Barrel, to 36 the depth in inches of a Tun, on the left, then right againſt 11 for 6 inches, the half of 23 foot is 53 in Barrels ¼ the fourth part of 213, the content ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to 282 inches in a Gallon. Note, I count 3 foot on the left ſide for 30 inches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
